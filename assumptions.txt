List of assumsions made to create project:

1. We have not been told the exact triggers of what to do after a main event has ocoured eg: What do do after an order had been collected or fufilled.
without being told this exactly i have assumed a very basic approach that when something is done it is removed from the pannel on the next refresh
this ommits all ideas about creating a previous orders dashboard for managers ect to see store statistics.

2. We were not told that all orders must have an order ID, without this it would be impossible to track the order. I implumented this in a very
simple method by just applying the orderID to the start of the database collumn so that it is easy to look back upon for the system to gather an 
order together. Without this you would be unable to keep orders together.

3. We were not provided information on the hardware within the system so we were not able to factor that into the design eg: we were not told the 
orientation of the screens that these will be running on.

4. We were not told how it is expected for windows to be moved between. I decided to make a realistic ish aproach to the system by designing it to be
able to run on multiple devices around a larger facility as in reality the ordering may be in the foye fufilment in the kitchen and progress may be
on the counter. For this reason I chose to implument it was multiple windows with no way to 'merge' them into one master application. I decided that
this mirrors a more realistic system that may be used.

5. Data. We were not told much about data handling we were told to use a databse but it was not explained much further than this. I know that in a 
realistic deployment they may use a centralised server to run 'data_controller.py' and 'orders.db' as it would allow for the screens to be run on 
seperate machines but that was not necisary given the scope of the project.
