List of assumsions made to create project:

1. Hardware Requirements not set
    1a. Orders.db and data_controller should be installed on a centralised server
    1b. Fufilment, ordering and progress are all on different machines around the institution and all comunicate with the centralised server.
    1c. The ordering program will be hooked up to a large touchscreen that is horizontal
    1d. There would be a secure payment method avaialble. For now this is represented with a notification window.

2. Database Requirements not set
    2a. We are asked to create a menu, it is not specified how this should be accessed so i have assumed that it can be manually
        updated and does not require its own interface
    2b. We are not told weather to store ordered eveafter completion for data analasys so i have chosen not to to simplify the project
    2c. We have nto been told what data to store about each menu item. I have chosen to only store basic details but it could be expanded
        to show extra data like nutritional data.

3. User Accessibility not set
    3a. We have not been told about any possible user accessibility needs such as dexterity or vision issues, this could cause issues down
        the line.
    
There was also many small and menial assumsions made during the creation of this project that have not affected the final project in any 
way that would be any different from a real life commercial application.
